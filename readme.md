But We Use Functions Because:
✅ Research Requirements:
Multiple model architectures (LSTM vs LSTM-Attention)
Different data modes (with/without dengue history)
Multiple prediction horizons (1-4 weeks ahead)
Custom metrics specific to epidemiological forecasting
✅ Code Reusability:
Same training logic for all 16 experiments
Consistent evaluation across all models
Easy to modify hyperparameters
✅ Professional Standards:
Modular, maintainable code
Easy debugging and testing
Clear separation of concerns
